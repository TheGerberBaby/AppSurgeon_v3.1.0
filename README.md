# App Surgeon

> Extract ZIP > double‑click `run.cmd` (or right‑click `AppSurgeon.ps1` > Run with PowerShell).
> Dry‑Run is ON by default. To make real changes, toggle Dry‑Run OFF and confirm.

- Portable Windows debloat/removal tool focused on safe app cleanup and system hygiene; ships as a ZIP with no installer and fully inspectable source.
- Built entirely in PowerShell (5.1+ compatible) with a WPF/XAML-based GUI; no external runtimes required.
- Target distribution: portable ZIP; runs from any folder without elevation by default, with optional admin operations when needed.
- Development focus: small, auditable codebase; deterministic behavior; friendly UI for selecting and previewing removals.
- Next step: bring up a Hello-World WPF window (single .ps1) and a minimal build script to zip the portable distribution.
